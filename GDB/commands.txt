1. To run gdb debugger in c++ program compile program using -g option
    a. g++ -g <cpp file> -o <output file>
    b. ex -- g++ -g gdb.cc -o gdb

2. Once program is compiled run with gdb option
   -- gdb gdb (Specify output file which we get after compilation)


3. Once we enter gdb mode first we need to apply breakpoints then run program

1. b -- Apply breakpoint. Pass function name to it

2. r, run -- Run program and stops where breakpoints is added

3. n, next -- Go to next line

4. p, print -- print any variable value

5. s, step -- go inside function

6. f, frame -- display current position where you are.

7. bt, backtrace -- Shows path from begining to current position. How you reached there

8. info break -- List all breakpoints in your program

9. c, continue -- If you apply breakpoint to func and enter continue it will go to that func directly.

10. q, quit -- Quit gdb
