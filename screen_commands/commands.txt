screen command in Linux provides the ability to launch and use multiple shell sessions from a single ssh session. When a process is started with ‘screen’, the process can be detached from session & then can reattach the session at a later time. When the session is detached, the process that was originally started from the screen is still running and managed by the screen itself. The process can then re-attach the session at a later time, and the terminals are still there, the way it was left.

1. Install command: sudo apt install screen

2. screen -S s1 -- Creates screen with name s1

3. screen -ls -- list all screen created

4. screen -d <name or id> -- Dettach screen without stopping process

5. screen -r <name or id> -- Reattach to the detached screen

6. exit -- If we run exit in screen window then it deletes screen ssh session
